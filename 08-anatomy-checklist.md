# HBR Anatomy & Style Checklist

> Use this pre-flight checklist to verify your generated charts against the HBR Data & Visuals editorial hallmarks.

## 1. Title & Framing
- [ ] **Declarative Title**: Does the title state a conclusion/insight (not just variables)?
- [ ] **Serif Typeface**: Is the title in a bold, high-contrast serif font?
- [ ] **Charcoal Color**: Is the title dark charcoal (#222222), not pure black?
- [ ] **Interpretive Subtitle**: Is there a 1–2 sentence sans-serif explainer in medium gray (#666666)?
- [ ] **Sub-label**: Is there a bold, smaller sans-serif metric descriptor (often a question)?

## 2. Visual Encoding
- [ ] **Ghost Elements**: If applicable, are reference/missing values shown in pale "ghost" washes (~15% opacity)?
- [ ] **Direct Labeling**: Are numeric values and category names placed directly on the data elements (no separate legend box)?
- [ ] **Color Restraint**: Are there maximum 2–3 accent colors used in total?
- [ ] **Flat Fills**: Are all elements flat, with zero gradients, drop shadows, or 3D effects?
- [ ] **Layered Dimensions**: Does the chart encode at least two dimensions of data (e.g., position + color, or size + position)?

## 3. Layout & Structure
- [ ] **Floating Container**: Does the chart float on a pure white background with no outer bounding box or frame?
- [ ] **Dotted Gridlines**: Are there only 4–5 horizontal dotted gridlines (and no vertical grid)?
- [ ] **Accent Axis**: Are axis labels colored in a non-black accent (teal, purple, etc.)?
- [ ] **Source Line**: Is there an italic, small gray source line in the bottom-left?
- [ ] **HBR Shield**: Is the HBR shield watermark present in the bottom-right corner?
- [ ] **Category Tag**: Is there a colored small-caps tag above the chart indicating the topic?

## 4. Anti-Pattern Check
- [ ] **No Hub-and-Spoke**: Is the layout linear or matrix-based (not radial)?
- [ ] **No Smoothing**: If a time series, is the line spiky and full-resolution (not a moving average)?
- [ ] **No Rainbows**: Are colors semantic and purposeful?
- [ ] **No Clutter**: Is there generous white space around all elements?
