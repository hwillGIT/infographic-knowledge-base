## Notes on Chart Selection

- **Quantitative comparisons**: Use horizontal bar, grouped bar with ghost bars, or Cleveland dot plot
- **Time series**: Use single bold time-series line or dual-line divergence chart
- **Sentiment / Likert data**: Use stacked bar (diverging) or diverging horizontal bar
- **Conceptual frameworks**: Use 2×2 matrix, S-curve, or process/value leakage flow
- **Cross-category comparison**: Use small multiples sparkline grid or bubble dot matrix
- **Geographic/multi-entity coverage**: Use color-coded qualitative matrix/heatmap
- **Relationships**: Use network/force-directed graph
- **Rankings**: Use ranked Pareto bar or lollipop-to-bubble chart

> **Avoid**: Radial/hub-and-spoke layouts — HBR explicitly shows these as poor practice.
